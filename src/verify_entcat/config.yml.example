    title: "Code of Conduct"
    text: >
      The GEANT Data protection Code of Conduct (CoC) defines
      an approach on European level to meet the requirements of
      the EU data protection directive for releasing mostly
      harmless personal attributes to a Service Provider (SP)
      from an Identity Provider (IdP). For more information
      please see GEANT Data Protection Code of Conduct.


  "http://refeds.org/category/research-and-scholarship":
    title: "Research & Scholarship"
    text: >
      Candidates for the Research and Scholarship (R&S)
      Category are Service Providers that support research
      and scholarship interaction, collaboration or management
      as an essential component.

  "http://www.swamid.se/category/research-and-education":
    title: "Research & Education"
    text: >
      The Research & Education category applies to low-risk services that
      support research and education as an essential component. For instance, a
      service that provides tools for both multi-institutional research
      collaboration and instruction is eligible as a candidate for this
      category. This category is very similar to InCommons Research &
      Scolarship Category. The recommended IdP behavior is to release name,
      eppn, eptid, mail and eduPersonScopedAffiliation which also aligns with
      the InCommon recommendation only if the services is also in at least one
      of the safe data processing categories. It is also a recommendation that
      static organisational information is released.

      responsible for its operation.

  "http://www.swamid.se/category/nren-service":
    title: "National research and education network"
    text: >
      The application is provided by the Swedish NREN (SUNET) which is

    text: >
      The SFS 1993:1153 category applies to services that fulfill
      <a href='http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/
      Svenskforfattningssamling/Forordning-19931153-om-redo_sfs-1993-1153'
      target='_blank'>SFS 1993:1153</a>. SFS 1993:1153 limits membership in
      this category to services provided by Swedish HEI-institutions, VHS.se or
      SCB.se. Example services include common government-operated student- and
      admissions administration services such as LADOK and NyA aswell as
      enrollment and course registration services. Inclusion in this category
      is strictly reserved for applications that are governed by SFS 1993:1153
      which implies that the application may make use of norEduPersonNIN. The
      recommended IdP behavior is to release norEduPersonNIN.
